use the same file/folder structure for the front end, the folder and name in the code are editable, so edit according to your liking.

you need pycharm or vs code with lastet version and a lastest version google chrome to run this for better user experience. if the front gives any error message its a faklse message, the video downloading has 100% success rate for me during my usage.
